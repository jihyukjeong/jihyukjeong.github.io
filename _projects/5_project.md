During my B.Eng., Mechanical Engineering degree at McGill University, I have worked as an undergraduate research assistant at various research groups. Notably, I have worked at the Aerodynamics Research Group under the supervision of Professor Timothy H. Lee. The main objective was to investigate the performance of the reverse delta wing and the effect of the ground effect. Firstly, to investigate the lift and drag of the reverse delta wing in comparison to the NACA0012 airfoil and a delta wing, force balance experiment was performed. Then surface pressure measurements using seven-hole probes were conducted to create a pressure map of the NACA0012 airfoil with and without the influence of the ground effect. Finally, smoke-wire flow visualization and dye-flow visualization of the NACA0012 airfoil, delta, and reverse delta wing were performed to visualize the vortices and vortex breakdowns and the overall flow patterns.

The obtained results were analyzed and presented in two journal articles with acknowledgements:
1. Lee, T. (2016). Impact of Gurney flaplike strips on the aerodynamic and vortex flow characteristic of a reverse delta wing. Journal of Fluids Engineering, 138(6), 061104.
