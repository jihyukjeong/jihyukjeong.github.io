<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am a Ph.D. Candidate at CETHIL, INSA Lyon and LMFTEUS, Université de Sherbrooke with an interest in contributing to a deeper understanding of fluid mechanics, especially in turbulent flows and computational fluid mechanics. During my research career, I have gained on-hands experience with turbulent flows and turbulent flow modelling through experiments and numerical simulations. Currenly looking for a Postdoctoral fellowship position in the field of aeronautics, fluid mechanic, and computational fluid dynamics.</p> <p>I envision my future research to span across interrelated sub-areas of CFD and turbulence modelling. The unifying theme of the research will be improving the accuracy of the current turbulence models and developing new techniques. In continuation of my current focus in CFD and heat and mass transfer, my near-term plan is to work on the research issues that include following:</p> <ul> <li>LES model for wind turbines or Atmospheric Boundary Layer.</li> <li>Turbulent multiphase model for the aviation and automotive applications.</li> <li>Modal decomposition of the fluid flows – Proper/Dynamic/Optimal Orthogonal Decompositions.</li> </ul> <p>While my experience is limited, I would also like to consider research in:</p> <ul> <li>Application of AI/ML in fluid flows.</li> <li>Combustion modeling – shockwaves, detonation, etc.</li> </ul> </body></html>
